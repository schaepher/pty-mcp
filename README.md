# pty-mcp

[![pty-mcp MCP server](https://glama.ai/mcp/servers/raychao-oao/pty-mcp/badges/score.svg)](https://glama.ai/mcp/servers/raychao-oao/pty-mcp)

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that gives AI agents interactive terminal sessions — local shells, SSH, serial ports, and persistent remote sessions that survive disconnects.

Built for **sysadmins and network engineers** who want AI to help with real server and device management, not just code generation.

## Why

AI agents run commands in non-interactive shells. They can't:
- SSH into a server and interact with running processes
- Connect to routers or switches via serial console
- Monitor logs and react when a specific event occurs
- Keep session state across multiple commands
- Wait for a server to reboot and detect when it's back up

pty-mcp solves all of these by providing real PTY sessions over MCP.

Without pty-mcp, AI agents resort to `sleep 30 && check_status` loops — burning CPU cycles and API calls waiting for things to happen. With `wait_for`, the agent blocks server-side until the event occurs. Less polling, less energy, better for polar bears. 🐻‍❄️

## Use Cases

**Server administration**
```
# Reboot a server and wait until it's back online
create_local_session("ping myserver")
read_output(wait_for: "bytes from", timeout: 300)
→ blocks until server responds after reboot (~80s, one tool call)
```

**Network device management**
```
# Connect to a router via serial console
create_serial_session(port: "/dev/ttyUSB0", baud: 9600)
send_input("show interfaces status")
read_output(wait_for: "\\$")
```

**Log monitoring and alerting**
```
# Watch logs and act when something happens
create_ssh_session(host: "prod", user: "admin")
send_input("tail -f /var/log/app.log")
read_output(wait_for: "ERROR|CRITICAL", timeout: 3600)
→ returns the error line + context when it appears
```

**Long-running tasks that survive disconnects**
```
create_ssh_session(host: "server", user: "admin", persistent: true)
send_input("apt upgrade -y")
detach_session()          → close Claude Code, task continues
# Reconnect later to check result
```

## Quick Start

### Claude Code Plugin (recommended)

Installs the binary automatically and registers the MCP server:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add raychao-oao/pty-mcp
claude plugin install pty-mcp@pty-mcp
```

Restart Claude Code — the binary downloads automatically on session start, then **restart once more** to activate it. No manual `claude mcp add` needed.

**Updating:**

```bash
claude plugin marketplace update pty-mcp
claude plugin update pty-mcp@pty-mcp
```

Restart Claude Code — the new binary downloads automatically on session start, then **restart once more** to apply the update.

### Manual install

**One-line install + register** (macOS / Linux / WSL2):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raychao-oao/pty-mcp/main/install.sh | sh
claude mcp add pty-mcp -- /usr/local/bin/pty-mcp
```

Restart Claude Code and the tools are available.

```bash
chmod +x pty-mcp-*
sudo mv pty-mcp-* /usr/local/bin/pty-mcp
claude mcp add pty-mcp -- /usr/local/bin/pty-mcp
```

**Build from source** (requires Go 1.25+):

```bash
go install github.com/raychao-oao/pty-mcp@latest
claude mcp add pty-mcp -- $(go env GOPATH)/bin/pty-mcp
```

</details>

### WSL2 Notes

pty-mcp works in WSL2 out of the box. Use the Linux binary:

```bash
# Inside WSL2
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raychao-oao/pty-mcp/main/install.sh | sh
claude mcp add pty-mcp -- /usr/local/bin/pty-mcp
```

### Optional: Install ai-tmux on remote servers

For persistent sessions that survive SSH disconnects, install `ai-tmux` on your remote server:

```bash
# Download for your server's architecture
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raychao-oao/pty-mcp/main/install.sh | sh
# Or just copy the binary:
scp /usr/local/bin/ai-tmux your-server:/usr/local/bin/ai-tmux
```

### Usage Examples

Once registered, the AI agent can use these MCP tools:

**Local interactive shell:**
```
create_local_session()                    → {session_id, type: "local"}
send_input(session_id, "cd /tmp && ls")   → {output: "...", is_complete: true}
send_input(session_id, "python3")         → start Python REPL
send_input(session_id, "print('hello')")  → {output: "hello\n>>>"}
send_control(session_id, "ctrl+d")        → exit Python
close_session(session_id)
```

**SSH to remote server:**
```
create_ssh_session(host: "myserver", user: "admin")
send_input(session_id, "top")
send_control(session_id, "ctrl+c")        → stop top
```

**Wait for pattern (v0.2.0):**
```
create_local_session("ping myserver")
read_output(session_id, wait_for: "bytes from", timeout: 300)
→ blocks until server responds or 5 min timeout

send_input(session_id, "docker-compose up")
read_output(session_id, wait_for: "ready|error", timeout: 60, context_lines: 3)
→ returns matched line + 3 lines of context
```

**Send secret / password (v0.3.0):**
```
# AI detects a password prompt, calls send_secret instead of handling the password itself
create_ssh_session(host: "router", user: "admin")
read_output(session_id, wait_for: "Password:")   → session is waiting for input

send_secret(session_id, prompt: "Router admin password:")
→ native GUI dialog appears on the operator's screen (macOS: system dialog,
   WSL2: Windows Get-Credential, Linux: zenity/kdialog)
→ operator types password — it is sent directly to the PTY session
→ AI only sees: {success: true, length: 12}
→ password never appears in AI context or logs
```

**Persistent session (survives SSH disconnect):**
```
create_ssh_session(host: "server", user: "admin", persistent: true)
send_input(session_id, "make build")      → start long build
detach_session(session_id)                → disconnect, build continues

# Later (even after restart):
list_remote_sessions(host: "server", user: "admin")  → see running sessions
create_ssh_session(host: "server", user: "admin", session_id: "abc123")  → reattach
send_input(session_id, "echo $?")         → check build result
```

## MCP Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `create_local_session` | Start a local interactive terminal (bash, python3, node, etc.) |
| `create_ssh_session` | SSH to a remote host (supports SSH config aliases) |
| `create_serial_session` | Connect to a serial port device |
| `send_input` | Send a command and wait for output to settle |
| `read_output` | Read output, optionally wait for a pattern (`wait_for`, `timeout`, `context_lines`, `tail_lines`) |
| `send_control` | Send control keys (ctrl+c, ctrl+d, arrows, tab, etc.) |
| `send_secret` | Prompt the human operator for a secret via GUI dialog; sends it to the PTY session without exposing it to AI context or logs ¹ |
| `list_sessions` | List all active sessions |
| `close_session` | Close a session (terminates remote PTY) |
| `detach_session` | Disconnect but keep remote PTY running |
| `resize_session` | Resize the terminal window (rows/cols) for any session type |
| `list_remote_sessions` | List persistent sessions on a remote host |

> ¹ **`send_secret` platform support**: macOS uses a native password dialog (osascript). WSL2 uses `powershell.exe Get-Credential` (Windows GUI dialog). Linux with a display server uses `zenity` or `kdialog`. Headless Linux falls back to `/dev/tty`. On macOS/Linux, if the operator doesn't respond within 60 seconds, the dialog is dismissed and the call returns a timeout error instead of falling through to another dialog or waiting again; cancelling the call (e.g. pressing ESC in Claude Code) dismisses the dialog immediately the same way. **WSL2 is the exception: its dialog has no timeout and is never force-closed**, including on cancellation — killing a WSL-interop-launched process that owns an open Windows GUI window was found to freeze the hosting terminal (unresponsive to input, scrolling, and selection) until the operator closes that terminal, with no way to recover it short of that. The dialog just waits until the operator answers or clicks Cancel themselves, which exits normally.

## Audit Log

pty-mcp includes an optional audit log feature that records every `send_input` command to a central collector. This lets teams review and trace what AI agents did during a session.

> **Important:** This is a **voluntary, self-reporting** operation log. It relies on operators choosing to enable it and run the collector. Because pty-mcp runs on the operator's own machine, there is no technical mechanism to enforce logging — a non-compliant operator could simply run pty-mcp without audit enabled. This feature provides traceability for teams that *want* it, but **it is not a substitute for system-level audit tools** (e.g., auditd, syslog forwarding, SSH session recording) in environments where audit compliance is required.

### What it records

- Timestamp, operator identity, session ID, session type (local/ssh/serial), target host
- The exact input sent via `send_input` (including `raw=true` inputs like menu selections)
- Output snippet (first 2 KB) after each command
- A `cmd_id` linking the command to its output

`send_secret` is **never logged** — secrets entered via the GUI dialog do not appear in the audit log.

Commands and output snippets are **automatically redacted** before being written. The following patterns are replaced with `[REDACTED]` or `[PRIVATE KEY REDACTED]`:
- Key-value credentials: `password=`, `passwd:`, `token=`, `api_key=`, `access_key=`, `auth_token=`, `secret=`
- HTTP Authorization headers: `Authorization: Bearer …`, `Authorization: Basic …`, `Authorization: Token …`
- PEM private key blocks: `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` / `-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----`

### Setup

**Each operator runs once** to create their config and generate a token:

```bash
pty-mcp audit init
```

This creates `~/.config/pty-mcp/config` (chmod 600) with a randomly generated token and prints the token to share with the collector admin.

**The collector admin** starts the server (using the token from init output):

```bash
PTY_MCP_AUDIT_TOKEN=<token-from-init> \
  pty-mcp audit serve --port 9099 --log /var/log/pty-mcp-audit.jsonl
```

**Enable audit** after setting the collector URL in the config:

```bash
# Edit config and set: audit-url=http://your-collector:9099
pty-mcp audit enable
# Restart Claude Code to apply
```

To temporarily stop logging without losing your config:

```bash
pty-mcp audit disable
```

Operators without a config file are unaffected — audit is off by default.

### Audit modes

| Mode | Behaviour |
|------|-----------|
| `best-effort` (default) | Commands execute regardless of whether the log was written; entries are queued and retried in the background |
| `strict` | `send_input` is rejected if the audit entry cannot be delivered; use when logging is a team policy requirement |

### Reviewing logs

Logs are stored as JSONL (one JSON object per line), readable with standard tools:

```bash
# All commands by operator ray
grep '"user":"ray"' /var/log/pty-mcp-audit.jsonl | jq .

# Commands sent to a specific host
jq 'select(.target == "root@prod01")' /var/log/pty-mcp-audit.jsonl
```

## ai-tmux: Persistent Terminal Daemon

`ai-tmux` is a lightweight daemon that runs on remote servers, keeping PTY sessions alive across SSH disconnects. Think of it as tmux designed for AI agents.

### Install on remote server

```bash
# Cross-compile for Linux
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o ai-tmux-linux ./cmd/ai-tmux/

# Copy to server
scp ai-tmux-linux server:~/ai-tmux
ssh server "chmod +x ~/ai-tmux && sudo mv ~/ai-tmux /usr/local/bin/ai-tmux"
```

### How it works

- `ai-tmux server` — daemon mode, listens on Unix socket, manages PTY sessions
- `ai-tmux client` — bridge mode, forwards JSON protocol over stdin/stdout (used by pty-mcp over SSH)
- `ai-tmux list` — list active sessions

The daemon auto-starts when pty-mcp connects with `persistent: true`. Sessions are reaped after 30 minutes of inactivity.

pty-mcp checks `ai-tmux --version` on the remote host before opening a session and returns a clear error if the binary is missing or below the minimum required version — no cryptic connection errors.

## SSH Config Support

pty-mcp reads `~/.ssh/config` to resolve host aliases:

```
# ~/.ssh/config
Host myserver
    HostName 192.168.1.100
    User admin
    Port 2222
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

```
create_ssh_session(host: "myserver", user: "admin")
# Automatically resolves hostname, port, and identity file
```

## Requirements

- Go 1.25+
- For serial: appropriate device permissions
- For persistent sessions: `ai-tmux` binary on remote server
