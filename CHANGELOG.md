# Changelog

All notable changes to pty-mcp are documented here.

## [v0.11.9] - 2026-09-09

### Fixed
- On WSL2, `send_secret`'s 60s dialog timeout (or cancelling the call, e.g. ESC in Claude Code) killed the `powershell.exe Get-Credential` process to close the dialog. Confirmed this SIGKILLs across the WSL↔Windows interop boundary while it owns an open GUI window, which freezes the *hosting terminal itself* — unresponsive to input, scrolling, and selection, and not recoverable by killing anything afterward (reproduced with a bare `powershell.exe -Command Get-Credential` + `kill -9` from another window, no pty-mcp involved). WSL2's dialog no longer has a timeout and is never force-closed by pty-mcp; it now just waits for the operator to answer or click Cancel themselves, which exits normally. Other platforms (macOS/zenity/kdialog/tty) are unaffected and keep the 60s timeout.

## [v0.11.8] - 2026-08-17

### Fixed
- MCP `initialize` handshake declared a hardcoded `protocolVersion` of `2024-11-05` — the original MCP spec, four generations behind current — regardless of what the client requested. Bumped to `2025-11-25`, matching the version other in-house MCP servers built on official SDKs already negotiate. pty-mcp's stdio-only transport gets no network-visibility benefit from the newer 2026-07-28 stateless spec (that revision targets HTTP transport intermediaries), so this targets the current stateful version rather than the latest one.

## [v0.11.7] - 2026-08-13

### Fixed
- Cancelling an in-progress tool call (e.g. pressing ESC in Claude Code) used to hang the rest of the session: pty-mcp processed one JSON-RPC request at a time on a fully synchronous loop, so the cancelled call kept running to its full bounded timeout (up to 600s) and every *other* tool call — even on a different session — queued behind it unable to run. The server now handles requests concurrently, and MCP's `notifications/cancelled` is honored for real: a cancelled call's underlying wait is interrupted and its resources released within seconds instead of waiting out the original timeout, while unrelated sessions were never blocked in the first place. Different sessions run in parallel; operations on the same session remain serialized to avoid races introduced by the new concurrency (a per-session operation lock, itself cancellable while queued).
- `send_secret`'s macOS dialog rendered non-ASCII prompts (e.g. Chinese) as mojibake. The prompt text was passed through an environment variable and read back via AppleScript's `system attribute`, which doesn't decode it as UTF-8. It's now interpolated directly into the (escaped) AppleScript source instead, matching how the WSL2/PowerShell dialog already handled this.

### Known limitation
- SSH-based remote session reads and listing (`ai-tmux` RPC over an existing SSH connection) still can't be interrupted mid-flight once the underlying network read has started — cancelling stops it from blocking other tool calls immediately, but the read itself keeps running until it naturally completes or times out. Fixing this needs the remote transport reworked around context-aware deadlines, planned as a separate follow-up.

## [v0.11.6] - 2026-08-11

### Fixed
- `plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` was never included in the release version-sync list and had been stuck at `0.11.2` since at least v0.7.2. `claude plugin update` reads this file's version (not `marketplace.json`), so it silently reported "already at latest" on every release since — the CLI never actually detected an update was available. Now kept in sync as the 4th version file on every release.

## [v0.11.5] - 2026-08-11

### Fixed
- `send_secret`/`prepare_secret` no longer cascade through every GUI dialog fallback (and finally `/dev/tty`, hijacking whatever terminal the AI host is running in) when the operator simply never responds. A genuine timeout now returns immediately instead of falling through to the next platform's dialog. `guiDialogTimeout` reduced from 90s to 60s, so the worst case is now a single bounded 60s wait instead of up to ~180s across stages.

## [v0.11.4] - 2026-08-11

### Fixed
- `readSecretTTY`'s timeout path closed `/dev/tty` to unblock the blocked password read, but `term.ReadPassword`'s own deferred terminal-state restore only ran after that close — on an already-dead fd, silently failing and leaving the terminal stuck in raw/no-echo mode until the operator ran `stty sane`. The terminal is now explicitly restored before the fd is closed.
- `readSecretOsascript` (macOS) and `readSecretPowerShell` (WSL2) had no timeout at all, unlike the zenity/kdialog/tty paths. Since pty-mcp processes MCP requests on a single-threaded synchronous loop, an unanswered dialog on either platform blocked the entire server, not just the pending secret call. Both are now bounded by `guiDialogTimeout`.

## [v0.11.3] - 2026-08-10

### Fixed
- GUI secret dialogs (`send_secret`/`prepare_secret`) silently failed to appear on Linux when pty-mcp was launched by an MCP host (e.g. codex CLI) that spawns child processes with a stripped-down environment lacking `DISPLAY`/`WAYLAND_DISPLAY`/`XAUTHORITY`, even though the operator had a real graphical session. These are now recovered via `systemctl --user show-environment` before concluding no GUI is available.
- The `/dev/tty` fallback used after a GUI dialog failure had no timeout, so an operator who never responded left the tool call — and the pending PTY session — blocked indefinitely. Bounded to `guiDialogTimeout` (90s at the time).

## [v0.11.2] - 2026-05-21

### Fixed
- MCP `serverInfo.version` was hardcoded as `"0.7.2"` in `internal/mcp/server.go`. Now reads the `main.version` variable set via ldflags at build time, so the version reported to MCP clients matches the actual release tag.

## [v0.11.1] - 2026-05-21

### Fixed
- `install.sh` VERSION was not bumped during v0.11.0 release, causing the version-check logic to always download the stale v0.10.0 binary instead of upgrading. Plugin `update` command now correctly installs the new binary on next launch.

## [v0.11.0] - 2026-05-21

### Added
- **AI-native PAM protocol consumer side** — pty-mcp is now a first-class consumer of the HPKE sealed credential delivery protocol from cred-mcp; plaintext never enters LLM context.
  - `get_credential_bundle` tool — generates a signed `ConsumerBundle` (Ed25519 identity key + ephemeral X25519 session key); safe to pass to AI as transport to cred-mcp
  - `inject_secret` tool — receives a `SealedBox` from cred-mcp, HPKE-decrypts using the stored session key, writes plaintext directly to PTY via `WriteRaw`, zeroizes memory; returns only `{"success":true}`
  - Session keys are single-use: a second `inject_secret` with the same `session_id` always errors
  - Identity key persisted at `~/.config/pty-mcp/identity.key` (Ed25519 seed, mode 0600)
- **Credential audit log** — `bundle_generated`, `secret_injected`, and `inject_failed` events sent to audit collector; no plaintext, ciphertext, encapped key, or private key material is ever logged

## [v0.10.0] - 2026-05-19

### Added
- **`resize_session` tool** — resize the terminal window for local, SSH, serial, and remote persistent sessions; validated to rows ≤ 500 / cols ≤ 1000 to prevent uint16 wrap-around
- **Audit log credential redaction** — `send_input` commands and output snippets are scrubbed before being written to the audit log: `password=`, `token=`, `api_key=`, `Authorization: Bearer/Basic/Token` headers, and PEM private key blocks are replaced with `[REDACTED]` / `[PRIVATE KEY REDACTED]`
- **ai-tmux version check** — `create_ssh_session` (remote mode) now verifies `ai-tmux --version` on the remote host before opening a session; returns a clear error if the binary is missing or below the minimum required version (0.9.0); check fails closed
- **`send_raw` ai-tmux protocol method** — writes bytes directly to the remote PTY fd without appending `\r`; fixes `raw=true` inputs (`"y"`, `"1"`, single chars) and `send_secret` payloads on remote persistent sessions, which previously double-terminated due to the `send_input` fallback appending an extra `\r`

### Fixed
- **Remote `wait_for` now works on persistent sessions** — `send_input(wait_for=...)` previously bypassed the regex-match loop for `RemoteSession` and returned immediately; one-line fix ensures the wait_for path is always reached
- **Remote `send_control` output no longer lost** — `WriteRaw` now caches the `OutputResult` returned by ai-tmux `send_control` (same pattern as `send_input`); `ReadScreen` returns the cached output without an extra round-trip
- **Remote `raw=true` with non-control input** — `WriteRaw` fell back to `send_input` (which appends `\r`); now routes through `send_raw` for exact byte delivery

## [v0.9.1] - 2026-05-16

### Fixed
- **pwsh PTY encoding corruption on macOS** — commands containing `$true`, `$false`, `~`, or Unicode characters no longer produce `d@@@@: The term ... is not recognized` errors
  - Root cause: PSReadLine sends `ESC[6n` cursor-position queries; without a response it renders with garbage offsets, producing corrupted sequences that `StripANSI` could not clean
  - Fix: read goroutine now intercepts `ESC[6n` and replies `ESC[1;1R`; `Remove-Module PSReadLine` is then injected at startup (safe now that DSR responses are in place)
  - Additional: pwsh launched with `-NoLogo -NoProfile`; added `CLICOLOR=0` and `TERM_PROGRAM=` env vars; `$PSStyle.Progress` OSC indicator disabled; plain-text prompt function installed
  - `StripANSI` enhanced to handle OSC+ST, DCS, SOS/PM/APC sequences and calls `strings.ToValidUTF8` before regex

## [v0.9.0] - 2026-04-28

### Added
- `prepare_secret` tool — pre-stage a secret before a password prompt appears; stored in session buffer and automatically sent when a password prompt is detected (no agent round-trip needed)
- `line_ending` param on `prepare_secret` — agent specifies the line ending to append (`\r` default, `\r\n`, `\n`); handles device-specific requirements without hardcoding
- Settle detection before auto-sending buffered secret — waits up to 2s for output to stabilize so the device has switched to no-echo mode before the secret is sent
- `send_secret` now checks for a buffered secret first (from `prepare_secret`) before showing a GUI dialog

### Fixed
- Serial session `Write` now appends `\r` instead of `\r\n` — prevents stray `\n` from being interpreted as an empty password submission on serial console devices

## [v0.8.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- **Audit log** — optional voluntary operation log for `send_input` commands
- `pty-mcp audit init` — create config file (`~/.config/pty-mcp/config`) and generate shared token
- `pty-mcp audit enable` — uncomment `audit-url` in config (runs `init` first if no config exists)
- `pty-mcp audit disable` — comment out `audit-url`, preserving config and token
- `pty-mcp audit serve --port PORT --log FILE` — run HTTP collector; appends JSONL
- Two-phase audit: CmdEntry (before execution) + OutputEntry (after output), linked by `cmd_id`
- best-effort mode (default): async queue, non-blocking; strict mode: rejects `send_input` if log cannot be delivered
- `send_secret` is never logged

> **Note:** This is a voluntary, self-reporting operation log. It is not a substitute for system-level audit tools (auditd, SSH session recording, etc.).

## [v0.7.2] - 2026-04-07

### Fixed
- `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` guard in `install.sh` — early exit if not set (was silently pointing to `/bin`)
- `grep | awk` pipeline in checksum verification now uses `|| true` to prevent `set -e` exit on no match
- `|| echo "unknown"` fallback in version check pipeline prevents silent exit
- `trap 'rm -f ...' EXIT` — temp files cleaned up on any exit (success or failure)
- curl timeouts added: `--connect-timeout 10 --max-time 25 --retry 2` for binary download
- SessionStart hook timeout increased: 30s → 60s

## [v0.7.1] - 2026-04-07

### Fixed
- `logRotator` thread safety — added `sync.Mutex`; Write/Close/rotate all locked
- `rotate()` nil dereference on `OpenFile` failure — now logs error and returns instead of panic
- `wait_for` timeout no longer marks buffer position, preserving unread output for subsequent reads
- Timeout tail output now includes last partial line (e.g. shell prompt)

## [v0.7.0] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- `wait_for` and `wait_for_timeout` params in `send_input` — combine send + wait in one tool call
- `timed_out: true` field in wait result — explicit boolean, agent doesn't need to parse error strings
- Log rotation: `log_max_size` (MB) and `log_max_files` params on all `create_*_session` tools
- `list_remote_sessions` `status` filter — client-side filtering by session status

### Fixed
- `wait_for` prompt matching now checks `remainder` (incomplete lines without trailing newline) — patterns like `console>` or `#` now match immediately instead of timing out

## [v0.6.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added
- `send_input` `raw` param — `raw=true` skips appending `\n`, for interactive menus (router CLI, BIOS, Sophos)
- `send_input` returns `cursor_start` / `cursor_end` for command boundary tracking
- Prompt classifier (`internal/session/classifier.go`) — classifies last 2 KB of output into: `at_prompt`, `password_prompt`, `confirmation`, `pager`, `running`, `unknown`
- `get_session_state` returns `state`, `awaiting_secret`, `last_prompt`
- `UnmarshalMcpArgs` helper using `mitchellh/mapstructure` with `WeaklyTypedInput: true` — fixes MCP clients sending all params as JSON strings

## [v0.5.0] - 2026-04-03

### Added
- `max_bytes` param in `read_output` — chunked incremental reads; `has_more: true` signals more unread data
- `log_file` param on all `create_*_session` tools — PTY output tee'd to file via `io.MultiWriter`
- Default ring buffer size: 256 KB → 1 MB; max: 4 MB → 32 MB

### Fixed
- Cursor now reflects bytes actually read (not total written)
- `ReadSinceMax` clamps future cursor to `rb.written` (prevents stuck cursor)
- `is_truncated` check in `waitForPattern` was always false

## [v0.4.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- `get_session_state` tool — returns session metadata and buffer cursor position
- Cursor-based incremental reads: `since_cursor` param in `read_output`
- Structured error codes: `ToolError{Code, Message, Retryable}` with `classifyError()` heuristic
- Typed errors: `SessionNotFoundError`, `SessionLimitError`

## [v0.3.1] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- AppleScript / PowerShell injection in `send_secret`; `zenity --no-markup`
- Goroutine leak fix
- Session limits: 50 active / 100 total
- `crypto/rand` session IDs
- Serial device path validation
- SSH `known_hosts` enforcement
- SHA256SUMS added to releases; `install.sh` verifies checksum

## [v0.3.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- `send_secret` tool — platform-native GUI password dialog (macOS: osascript, WSL2: Get-Credential, Linux: zenity/kdialog, headless: /dev/tty); password never exposed to AI context or logs
- Claude Code plugin packaging — `claude plugin marketplace add raychao-oao/pty-mcp`
- Community files: CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, SECURITY, issue/PR templates

## [v0.2.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- `wait_for` param in `read_output` — blocks until regex pattern appears in output
- `context_lines` param — returns matched line plus N lines of surrounding context
- `tail_lines` param — returns last N lines on timeout
- Ring buffer (bounded memory) — prevents OOM on long-running sessions

## [v0.1.0] - 2026-03-23

### Added
- Initial release
- `create_local_session` — interactive local PTY (bash, python3, node, etc.)
- `create_ssh_session` — SSH to remote hosts; reads `~/.ssh/config` aliases
- `create_serial_session` — serial port devices (IoT, network gear)
- `send_input`, `read_output`, `send_control` — interact with sessions
- `list_sessions`, `close_session` — session lifecycle management
